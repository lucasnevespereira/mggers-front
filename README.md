## App to report muggers, find nearest police stations and medical cares

### Problematic

There is actually two main problematics here:

- First, when a crime occurs, for example a mugger took your wallet. We take way too long to contact the police, because we donâ€™t know where the nearest police station is. So we call the general police number (911, 112, 17) that then redirects the information to the nearest police station I guess.
    
    So a first solution, is to be able to contact directly the nearest police station.
    
- Second, after you got robbed or something like that, the mugger goes away, you cannot catch him. That same robber can be seen by anyone in the area or in a worst case scenario he could attack another person near you.
    
    A solution for this would be to be able to report that mugger, with a possible description.
    

### App

- Display a map with the current user position.
- The map should include the nearest police stations and their contact.
- Also a button to report a mugger at your current position.
- Bonus Feature:
    - Be able to submit a draw of the mugger
